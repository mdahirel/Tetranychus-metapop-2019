# Saved outputs

If you run the scripts for the first time, models and some other time-consuming outputs will be saved in this folder so you don't have to re-run them everytime.

See annotated code in `R/tetranychus-metapop-2019-script-annotated.Rmd` for details about each file that can be generated in the course of the analysis (most are not saved by default with the repo, as they are large).
