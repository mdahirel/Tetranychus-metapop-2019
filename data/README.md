# Raw data sources

This folder contains the raw experimental data files 
(for data files saved during the code execution _ results tables, model files... _ see the `R_output` folder)
(for simulation results saved for the Supplementary Material, see the `simulation_output` folder)

- `tetranychus-metapop-2019-dataset.csv` contains the main experiment data. See code in `R/tetranychus-metapop-2019-script-annotated.Rmd` for info about each column, and analysis
- `tetranychus-metapop-2019-bridge-trials.csv` contains data from preliminary trials looking at the effect of bridge length on dispersal mortality costs. See the Supplementary Material and code in `R/tetranychus-metapop-2019-supplementary.Rmd` for details and analysis.
- `prior_data.csv` is a copy of the relevant prior data in De Roissart et al. (2015) Journal of Animal Ecology (https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12400) (full data are in Dryad https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.18r5f and were placed there by the authors with a public domain dedication). These are used in `R/tetranychus-metapop-2019-script-annotated.Rmd` to help determine some of the priors for our analyses.
