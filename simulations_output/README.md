# Supplementary simulation output

Output from simulations designed to examine the effect of connectedness loss in the absence of density-dependent dispersal and evolution (and thus provide a baseline to help interpret our results).

The source model can be found at https://github.com/fremorti/Metapopulation_variability_model 

See Supplementary Material and its underlying code in `R/tetranychus-metapop-2019-supplementary.Rmd` for a detailed description of the model and analysis.
